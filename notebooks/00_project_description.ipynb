    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the application of neural networks for demand forecasting in retail environments. The primary objective is to answer whether neural models – from simple dense networks (MLP) to more advanced architectures like LSTM – can effectively predict product demand and thereby support optimization of supply chain costs and inventory management."
